# Running a React Project Locally

This repository contains a React project that you can run on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal.
   - Use the `git clone` command to clone this repository.
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/username/project-name.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project folder.
     ```
     cd project-name
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Inside the project directory, install the necessary dependencies.
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the React App:**
   - Once the dependencies are installed, start the React development server.
     ```
     npm start
     ```

4. **View the Application:**
   - Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000/`.
   - You should see the React application running locally.

## Stopping the Server

To stop the React development server, go back to your terminal and press `Ctrl + C`.

## Additional Information

- Make sure no other services are using port `3000` as it's the default port for the React app. If it's in use, you can specify a different port by editing the `package.json` file:

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start"
  }
